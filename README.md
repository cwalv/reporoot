Software lives in multiple repos. Even a monorepo has upstream dependencies, vendored libraries, etc., where the source of truth is elsewhere. The code you work with almost always spans repos you own, repos you depend on (or forked), and maybe even repos you just want around as a reference.

The value of a monorepo is the workspace — all your code in one directory tree, so every tool that touches the filesystem works across all of it. Reporoot gives you the workspace without merging repos. A project `.repos` file declares which repos belong together; `reporoot activate` wires them into ecosystem workspace mechanisms so cross-repo imports resolve locally. Repos stay sovereign: normal clones, normal branches, normal git.

```
reporoot/
├── github/
│   ├── myorg/
│   │   ├── server/          # your code
│   │   ├── web/             # your code
│   │   └── protocol/        # shared types, used by both
│   └── socketio/
│       └── engine.io/       # your fork with reconnection fixes
├── projects/
│   └── web-app/
│       ├── web-app.repos    # which repos, what roles
│       └── web-app.lock.repos
├── package.json             # generated: npm workspaces
├── go.work                  # generated: Go workspace
└── web-app.code-workspace   # generated: VS Code workspace
```

One `reporoot activate web-app` generates the ecosystem workspace files, and `import { Thing } from '@myorg/protocol'` just works — resolved locally, no `file:../../` paths.

## Why not just...

**...use a monorepo?** You'd need everyone to buy in, and you still have external deps, forks, and reference code outside the repo. The coordination problem exists either way.

**...use git submodules?** Submodules take ownership: detached HEAD by default, can't adopt existing clones, the parent controls the relationship. For repos you don't control, this is backwards.

**...clone repos into a flat directory?** Works for one person who set it up. Fails for: reproducing on a new machine, onboarding someone, remembering why a repo was cloned six months later.

Reporoot is the layer in between — structure and reproducibility without giving up repo independence.

## Install

```bash
pipx install reporoot
```

## Quickstart

**Starting fresh:**

```bash
mkdir ~/reporoot && cd ~/reporoot
reporoot fetch myorg/web-app    # clones project + all its repos
```

**Adopting existing repos:**

```bash
cd ~/reporoot
reporoot activate web-app       # wires existing repos into workspace
```

`reporoot activate` reads the project's `.repos` file and runs integration hooks — generating npm workspaces, `go.work`, uv workspaces, gita config, and a VS Code workspace — so cross-repo imports resolve locally without path hacks.

## Three layers

### 1. The directory tree

Repos live under one root at `{registry}/{owner}/{repo}/`. This is just a directory convention — no tooling required. But every tool benefits: grep finds results across repos, editors navigate the full tree, agents see all the code.

### 2. Ecosystem wiring

`reporoot activate` generates per-ecosystem workspace files from the active project's repos:

| Ecosystem | Generated file | What it enables |
|---|---|---|
| **Node** (npm) | `package.json` with `workspaces` | `import { x } from '@myorg/shared'` resolves locally |
| **Go** | `go.work` | `import "myorg/shared"` resolves locally |
| **Python** (uv) | `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.uv.workspace]` | editable installs across repos |
| **gita** | `.gita/` config | `gita ll`, `gita super pull`, role-based groups |
| **VS Code** | `{project}.code-workspace` | single-root workspace, non-project repos hidden |

Each integration auto-detects relevant repos (has `package.json`? include in npm workspaces) and skips gracefully if the tool isn't installed.

### 3. Reproducibility

A `.repos` file declares which repos belong to a project. `reporoot lock` snapshots every repo's HEAD into a `.lock.repos` file — the multi-repo equivalent of a monorepo commit hash.

```bash
# On a new machine — one command to reproduce the full workspace
reporoot fetch myorg/web-app
```

`sha256sum web-app.lock.repos` gives a single fingerprint for the entire project state.

## Projects

Projects are named views over subsets of repos, with roles that signal how freely code should be changed:

```yaml
# projects/web-app/web-app.repos
repositories:
  github/myorg/server:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/myorg/server.git
    version: main
    role: primary              # your code — change freely
  github/myorg/protocol:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/myorg/protocol.git
    version: main
    role: primary
  github/socketio/engine.io:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/myorg/engine.io.git
    version: main
    role: fork                 # your fork — changes ideally go upstream
```

Repos can appear in multiple projects with different roles. Switching projects is fast — repos are already on disk, only the ecosystem wiring changes:

```bash
reporoot activate mobile-app
# Regenerates package.json, go.work, etc. for mobile-app's repos
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |

| `reporoot activate {project}` | Set active project, run integration hooks |
| `reporoot deactivate` | Remove derived files, clear active project |
| `reporoot add {url\|path}` | Clone a repo and register it in the active project |
| `reporoot fetch {source}` | Clone a project and all its repos |
| `reporoot resolve` | Print the workspace root path |
| `reporoot lock` | Snapshot repo versions for the active project |
| `reporoot lock-all` | Snapshot repo versions for all projects |
| `reporoot check` | Run convention enforcement checks |
